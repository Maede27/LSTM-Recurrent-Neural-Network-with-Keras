# LSTM-Recurrent-Neural-Network-with-Keras
Long Short Term Memory networks, called LSTMs, are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Networks, capable of learning long-term dependencies and used in the field of deep learning. 
Time series prediction, speech recognition, rhythm learning, music composition, handwriting recognition, human action recognition, and short-term traffic forecast are some applications of LSTM neural networks.
